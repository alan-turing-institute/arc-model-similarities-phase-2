# Scripts

## Calculate Metrics

Call:

```bash
python scripts/metrics_script.py
```

to generate bash scripts that in turn call `scripts/calculate_metrics.py` to compute metrics for a single DMPair.

## Train Models

Call:

```bash
python scripts/train_script.py
```

to generate bash scripts that in turn call `scripts/train_models.py` to train both models for each DMPair.
